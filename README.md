# KumpeHelpers
KumpeHelpers is a collection of helper files commonly used in most of my apps. I created this framework as an easy way of importing my most frequently used scripts instead of having to re-write them or copy/past each app and easily syncing changes between all of my apps. So.....this framework is designed for my use but feel free to use it if you wish.

## Frameworks Used
- Foundation
- CoreData
- UIKit
- CoreText

## Third Party Frameworks Used
- [Alamofire-SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/Alamofire-SwiftyJSON)
- [SwiftMessages](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages)
- [Sync](https://github.com/3lvis/Sync)
- [ReachabilitySwift](https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift)

## Scripts that I incorporated form third party sources
- Pathifier (obtained from a Udacity nanodegree course)
- [String+Image (obtained form an example code on stack overflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38809425/convert-apple-emoji-string-to-uiimage)
- [Logger (code was copied in part from stack overflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40583721/print-to-console-log-with-color/41740104)
- [Rotate Image (most of class was copied from stack overflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49666907/custom-image-with-rotation-in-activity-indicator-for-iphone-application-in-swift)
